I'm a master's student in [the Department of Electronics Engineering](https://ee.cnu.ac.kr/html/ee/sub07/sub07_0701.html) at the Chungnam National University under the supervision of [Prof. Donghyeon Cho](https://sites.google.com/view/cnu-cvip).

My current research interests are virtual reality (VR) and digital human 3D reconstruction.
I have been developing deep neural network algorithms to implement immersive reality with ETRI's immersive media lab since 2020.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `pro.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
